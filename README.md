This is a Pomodoro Timer app useful for increasing your daily productivity.

At the moment, the timer is preset to 25 minutes. You can stop or restart the timer and the interval completion will be marked by a Gong sound.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and I'm also using React Hooks.

You can visit the GitHub project page [here](https://ioanacosmina.github.io/timer-app/) to test the app or just clone the repository.

## Improvement ideas
- Add Break timer (5 mins duration)
- Add Custom Timer component
- Add To-Do / notes component
